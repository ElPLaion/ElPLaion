## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¡ Data Analyst transitioning from Dentistry to Technology, combining solid experience in operations and logistics with a multidisciplinary perspective built over a diverse career.

ðŸš€ Passionate about turning raw data into practical and actionable insights, I design simple pipelines, intuitive dashboards, and solutions that reduce costs, boost efficiency, and bring clarity to operations.

ðŸ”§ Tools I work with daily: SQL, Python, Advanced Excel, Power BI (modeling, DAX, storytelling), and ETL with Pentaho/DBeaver. My focus areas include inventory metrics, productivity, lead time, and data quality.

ðŸŽ¯ My journey proves that adaptability, discipline, and innovation can accelerate any professional transition. Today, I aim to contribute to data-driven Operations and Logistics teams, documenting processes clearly and ensuring smooth handovers.

ðŸ“š Continuously learning: pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence (Unifor, 2027) along with certifications in Data Analytics, Python, and Power BI.
